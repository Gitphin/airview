# Airview

## What is Airview?
This is an app that I am making to track details of airplanes flying above your general location. I wanted to make this app because my partner loves to track the flights of planes and see where they are going using a flight tracker app. Therefore, I wanted to make something that can be set up in a location and continuously displays planes flying over.

## What makes Airview different?
What I wanted for this app was to make it more visually appealing and something that can just be left on a monitor or screen. Therefore, it is always running and sending requests (which may pose an initial challenge when finding the right API to use). Going back to visuals, I wanted to make it more flashy with more customizable options and features than a normal flight tracker. For example, visuals of the plane type being used, the airline, locations its flying to (maybe even cool facts about the places it goes to) and more!

## Goals for this project
I want to complete this start to finish over a set period of time. I think if I just take things more slow and steady I will be able to get to where I need to be. And I want to really enjoy the process, and I think the concept is super cool so I think I can do that!
